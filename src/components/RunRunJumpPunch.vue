        <strong class="text-green-400">Run! Run! Jump! Punch!</strong> is a Chiptune / Punk rock band from Lille, France in which I play Synth, 
        and drum-programming.
        <br /><br />
        Born from a collision between Punk-rock and lo-fi/chiptune electronic music, Run! Run! Jump! Punch! delivers happiness where soft synth 
        melodies melt with catchy and energetic saturated guitars. Add a pinch of football-like chorus voices, and you will get all the ingredients 
        of their music, to listen to on records or to sweat in live !
